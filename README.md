**Foundations → Advanced**

## Phase 1: Graph Basics (Traversal & Representation)

1. **Find the Town Judge**
2. **Keys and Rooms**
3. **All Paths From Source to Target**
4. **Jump Game III**
5. **Graph Valid Tree**

👉 Focus on:

* DFS vs BFS
* Recursion vs iterative
* Detecting cycles / visited nodes

---

## Phase 2: Connected Components & Flood Fill (Matrix Graphs)

🎯 Goal: Master grid traversal (DFS/BFS on 2D matrices).

### Do in This Order

6. **Number of Islands**
7. **Max Area of Island**
8. **Number of Enclaves**
9. **Number of Closed Islands**
10. **Pacific Atlantic Water Flow**

👉 These problems are variations of:

* Multi-source BFS
* Boundary-based traversal
* Counting connected components

---

## Phase 3: BFS Shortest Path Patterns

🎯 Goal: Recognize shortest-path problems in unweighted graphs.

### Recommended Order

11. **Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze**
12. **01 Matrix**
13. **Shortest Path in Binary Matrix**
14. **Minimum Genetic Mutation**
15. **Word Ladder** *(Hard – do last in this phase)*

👉 Core ideas:

* Level-order BFS
* Queue states
* State pruning using visited sets

---

## Phase 4: Advanced BFS & State Space

🎯 Goal: BFS with additional constraints or state encoding.

16. **Shortest Bridge**
17. **Shortest Path with Alternating Colors**
18. **All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree**
19. **Shortest Path to Get All Keys** *(Hard)*

👉 Learn:

* BFS with `(node, state)`
* Bitmasking
* Multiple dimensions of visited

## Phase 5: Directed Graphs & Topological Sort

🎯 Goal: Dependency resolution and cycle detection.

### Order Matters Here

20. **Course Schedule**
21. **Course Schedule II**
22. **Alien Dictionary**
23. **Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies**
24. **Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph**

👉 Key skills:

* Kahn’s algorithm

* Cycle detection in DAGs

---

## Phase 6: Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)

🎯 Goal: Efficient grouping and connectivity checks.

25. **Satisfiability of Equality Equations**
26. **Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String**
27. **Accounts Merge**
28. **Similar String Groups** *(Hard)*

👉 Master:

* Path compression
* Union by rank
* Component merging

---

## Phase 7: Graph Theory & Network Problems

🎯 Goal: Higher-level graph reasoning.

29. **Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes**
30. **Maximal Network Rank**
31. **Is Graph Bipartite?**
32. **Find Eventual Safe States**
33. **Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero**
34. **Time Needed to Inform All Employees**

---

## Phase 8: Advanced Graph Algorithms (Hard)

🎯 Goal: Industry-level graph skills.

35. **Critical Connections in a Network** *(Tarjan’s Algorithm)*

---

## How to Practice Effectively

✅ For each problem:

* Solve once with **DFS**
* Ask: *Could BFS also work?*
* Identify the **pattern** (flood fill, shortest path, topo, DSU)
